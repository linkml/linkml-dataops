  RemoveObject:
    aliases:
      - deletion
    description: |-
      A change object that represents the removal of an object from another object

        description: if true, then the object to be removed must be present

  ReplaceObject:
    aliases:
      - remove and add
    description: |-
      A change object that represents the removal of an object from another object followed by an add
